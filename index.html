    <h2>Reveal (Modal)</h2>
    <p>A modal is just an empty container, so you can put any kind of content inside it, from text to forms to video to an entire grid.</p>
    <div class="callout primary">
      <p>Please note that we removed the option for AJAX loaded modals in Foundation 6. We did make it very easy to implement on your own though, check out a sample in the <span><a href="//foundation.zurb.com/sites/docs/reveal.html#advanced-options">Advanced</a></span> section.</p>
